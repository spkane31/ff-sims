# Fantasy Football Report

A fun side-project where I run some simulations and do fun analysis for my fantasy football league.

This uses the [espn_api](https://github.com/cwendt/espn-api) to fetch results.

## Scripts

Python scripts for getting the data from ESPN.

## Simulation (work in progress)

I want to do the Monte Carlo simulation portion in Rust as a learning experience, maybe this year I actually will ...

## web-app

This will eventually be some sort of web page that I can easily host and easily share with friends.
